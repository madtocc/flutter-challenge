### Objective

Using Dart and Flutter, your challenge is to build out a photo viewer mobile app, integrate it with the [Pexels API](https://www.pexels.com/api/documentation/), and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

### Brief
Your users should be able to view the photos fetched from the API:

-   View the optimal layout for the mobile app depending on their device's screen size
-   See a list of the photos (only show the image + title)
   
Your task is to build out the project accordingly to the [figma](https://www.figma.com/file/XT8fB9uLMxIyk1HXHDYTEn/flutter-challenge?node-id=0%3A1): 

To achieve this, you should use the [Pagination](https://www.pexels.com/api/documentation/#pagination).

Call example:

```GET https://api.pexels.com/v1/curated?page=0&per_page=10```


This call returns the first 10 entries.

Note you should also get an API key, if you don't want; use this key instead `563492ad6f91700001000001618430f2bc1040abb7708fe17836fdd5`

### Evaluation Criteria

-   **Dart** best practices
-   Show us your work through your commit history
-   We're looking for you to produce working code with enough room to demonstrate how to structure components in a small program
-   Completeness: did you complete the features?
-   Correctness: does the functionality act insensible, thought-out ways?
-   Maintainability: is it written in a clean, maintainable way?

### Deliverables

Make sure to include all source code in the repository.

### CodeSubmit

Please organize, design, test, and document your code as if it were going into production - then push your changes to the main branch. After you have pushed your code, you may submit it to us.
